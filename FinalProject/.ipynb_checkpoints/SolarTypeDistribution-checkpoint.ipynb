    "The redistribution of material during the merger is interesting because it can have an effect on the distribution of metal rich dust post-merger. This metal rich dust is the environment in which stars form and, if it migrates, there can be interesting features in the merger product such as a flocculant distrbution of star formation.\n",
    "The tidal forcing which causes the redistribution will change not only the position distribution but a velocity distribution as well. This should in theory lead to a more dispersion supported merger product rather than an entirely rotation supported galaxy."
